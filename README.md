# 🚀 Caio's Awesome Next.js Project

Hey there! Welcome to this super cool project built by **Caio**! 👋

## What's This All About?

This project is a static clone of Spotify's desktop UI built with Next.js and TypeScript. It recreates the sleek and modern interface of Spotify's desktop application, showing off front-end skills without the actual music streaming functionality. Currently, only the desktop version has been implemented, with mobile responsiveness planned for future updates.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** - For that sweet, sweet server-side rendering and routing
- **TypeScript** - Because we like our code typed and our errors caught early
- **Biome/ESLint** - Keeping our code clean and consistent
- **PNPM** - For super efficient package management

## Getting Started

Want to run this bad boy locally? Easy peasy!

```bash
